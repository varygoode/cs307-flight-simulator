This zip file contains 10 files:

1. ReadMe.txt - The text file you are reading now.

2. FlightSim02.txt - A data file listing the two files containing data on cities and flights.

3. CityData02.xml - A data file defining all of the cities in this version of the simulation with
	the distances between the cities.

4. AirlineFlightData02.xml - A data file defining all the aircraft and flights in the scenario. 

5. CityDataParser.h - The header file for a new parser for the city data file

6. CityDataParser.cpp - The implementation file for a new class that will handle reading and parsing 
	the city data file.  Look at the functions prototyped in the header file for details on 
	how it works.

7. FlightDataParser.h - The header file for a new parser for the airline flight data file.

8. FlightDataParser.cpp - The implementation file for a new class that will handle reading and parsing 
	the airline flight data file.  Look at the functions prototyped in the header file for details 
	on how it works.

9. AircraftTypes.h - A header file defining an enumerated data type for the different types of 
	aircraft.  This is required by the FlightDataParser.

10. Prog2.txt - This is actually an executable file with the extension changed to ".txt" to get
	around some fire walls.  Change the ".txt" extension back to ".exe" to run a demonstration
	of programming assignment 2.
